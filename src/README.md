# üìÑ Description - Exercise Statement

This project consists of creating a class named **"Cotxe"** with the attributes **brand**, **model**, and **power**. These attributes should be defined as follows:

- **brand**: `static final`
- **model**: `static`
- **horsePower**: `final`

The project will demonstrate the differences between these modifiers and determine which of them can be initialized within the constructor.

Additionally, two methods will be added to the **"Cotxe"** class:

- A **static** method called **brakeCar()**, which prints: *"El vehicle est√† frenant"* ("The car is braking").
- A **non-static** method called **acceleratingCar()**, which prints: *"El vehicle est√† accelerant"* ("The car is accelerating").

Finally, the **main()** method will demonstrate how to invoke both the static and non-static methods from the main class.
